Do you have an upcomming appointment with the German Embassy in Pakistan & you need the **<mark>English Translation of Nika Nama </mark> ?** You are in luck because I've got just the right document & advice for you.

## Context

First things first, let me give you some context of why I needed this document & for which visa category. Let's jump right in.

I recently had to appear for my appointment for the Work-Visa under the Blue-card category in the German Embassy. I am married & wanted to bring my wife along. Turns out, if you qualify for a blue-card, you can take your wife (spouse) along with you on your own appointment. Very convenient, thanks to the German Embassy.

This also meant that I had to collect documents for wife's application-under [family re-union visa category](https://pakistan.diplo.de/pk-en/service/1-visa-fz-seite/1676108). Remember, this is very important. There are still two visa applications, one for you & one for your spouse. Yes, you can take your spouse with you but it doesn't mean there is no application category for her.

So, I had to fill two applications, one for me for my work-visa & one for my wife under [family-reunion visa](https://pakistan.diplo.de/pk-en/service/1-visa-fz-seite/1676108). This is what the document checklist looks like for family-reunion visa*(the red-underlined point 12 is topic of this article)*

As you can see, the Point 12 is the most troublesome. I searched a lot & found a couple of documents appearing on most of the sites.

One of them was <mark>this 2-page document that I used</mark>. You can find the pdf link below where you can download it for free. I'm unable to add the PDF because the software I use for my website won't allow me upload PDFs, sorry.

However, I shall upload it on a couple of different sites for people to download from in case one of them doesn't work.

This is what that document looks like:

I found this document rather easily but I was still confused about a few things:

* Is this the right format or the right look?
    
* How do I fill it?
    
    * <s>I'll share how to do that in a separate article</s>
        
* Do I need certified English or something?
    
* Can I fill it on my own?
    
* Do I need to have it attested or notarised?
    

And million other questions. However, I took a chance of filling it on my own & presenting it to the German Embassy. It turns out:

* There is no right format
    
* There is no need for certified English or anything
    
* You can & should fill it on your own
    
* No need to have it attested or notarised

**Pro tip:** If nothing works, you can still make a pdf pretty easily. Just download the two Nikaah-naama images I attached above, go to this awesome ðŸ’¯% free website called [Tinywow](https://tinywow.com/) & covert your images into a PDF within 5 seconds.

I can not recommend this site enough, it'll change your online game for sure.
