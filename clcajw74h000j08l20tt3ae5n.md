# How to convert your SIM network from Jazz to Zong

<mark>This article is for you if you have a:</mark>

* non-PTA iPhone
    
* Jazz SIM - that you use primarily
    
* Zong SIM - optional
    

I have been a Mobilink/Jazz user for years now & I use only 1 SIM. My iPhone is meant to be used for a couple of months so I don't have to register it with PTA. I thought it would be simple enough but it so happened that this iPhone won't pick up any Jazz SIMs. Now, I don't want a new SIM so I searched for an alternative & found out that you can get an eSIM for your primary Jazz contact number.

**<mark>Disclaimer</mark>**: *An eSIM is basically the exact same thing as a standard SIM except that you don't need a physical SIM. Instead, the company gives you a code which you can scan & add it to your phone. Remember that not all phones support eSIM & not all networks offer eSIM. And, Jazz is one of those companies which offer it.*  

I went to Jazz franchise & they told me I have to convert my pre-paid SIM to post-paid & it would cost 2000 rupees, RS 1000 for the eSIM & RS 1000 security. The representative told me that there'll be two biometrics on two different days which was a deal breaker for me so I changed my plan & instead went to a Zong franchise & converted my SIM from Jazz to Zong. This is how it went:

* I sent a message to 667 with the message MNP
    
* I received a reply with some ***sensitive*** ***gibberish*** which I FORWARDED to 76313
    

After this, the representative wrote some numbers on a hand-sized machine & took my fingerprints. I paid him RS 200 & he handed me the SIM.  
He also gave me these instructions:

* The SIM will be converted within 24 hours
    
* When the old Jazz SIM loses it's signal that means the Zong SIM is now ready.
    
* When the new SIM have signals, I should dial \*10# which would do some necessary things.
    

I hope this helps!

Best,
