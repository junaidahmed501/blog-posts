Planning a visit to the German Embassy in Pakistan for a Blue Card work visa? If you're married, understanding the translation requirements for your Nikah Nama (marriage certificate) is crucial. This guide simplifies the process for you and your spouse.

**Key Steps for Couples Applying for a Blue Card Work Visa:**

1. **Separate Visa Applications:** Both you and your spouse need to submit individual visa applications. For your spouse, the application falls under the 'family reunion visa' category. This dual-application process is often overlooked but is essential for a successful visa approval.
    
2. **Document Checklist Clarity:** The family reunion visa requires adherence to a specific 2-page document checklist. Point 12 on this checklist pertains to your Nikah Nama. Don't worry about the format or certified translations; simply download the necessary information from the links provided in this post.
