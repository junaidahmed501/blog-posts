Hey Mani, I’ve one question here, my media URLs doesn’t have the keyword “media” in them. This is what I’m getting   
[https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/logo/bg-default.jpg](https://locl-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/logo/bg-default_vzNVrj5.jpg).  
“logo” keyword is the model’s “upload\_to” string. Is this how it should be or am I doing something wrong.
