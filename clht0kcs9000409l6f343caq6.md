This is an update on the post that I sent out in a LinkedIn group asking for some help. The original post goes like this:

*"I am interested in learning about the experience of individuals who have applied for a visa for their spouse at the same time as themselves.  
If my understanding is correct, the visa for the spouse is typically issued at a later time. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if someone could share their experience of applying and undergoing the interview process simultaneously for both visas."*  

Although group members shared as much as they knew, I still needed some more info that was unique to my situation. This is an update on that.

### <mark>I was able to successfully submit my visa application for me &amp; my spouse. Here are some key points:</mark>

1. If you are eligible for a Blue card (most of us are), you only need one appointment for you, your spouse & kids. Just make sure to select the "Blaue Karte or pre-approval..." option when submitting the form for an appointment. FYI, you should already know this from the FAJIG course.
    
2. The embassy usually responds within a week with a date/time slot for the interview.
    
3. Now that you've received your interview/appointment slot, it's time to collect the documents, by now, you should have already collected most of these, if not all.
    
4. You will be collecting documents for two applications, one for yourself of work visa/blue-card category & a second one for your spouse & kids of Family reunion type.
    
    **PS**: One application/set refers to a set of all the documents for a specific type of visa i.e. in our case, we have two visas so that means two applications.
    
5. Fill out & collect documents for your work visa (this is 1st application). Find more information on & the checklist over [here](https://pakistan.diplo.de/pk-en/service/-/2593356).
    
    1. You need two identical sets of this application
        
6. Fill out & collect documents for your family's Family reunion visa (this is 2nd application). Find more information on & the checklist over [here](https://pakistan.diplo.de/pk-en/service/1-visa-fz-seite/1676108).
    
    1. You need three identical sets of this application
        
7. You should have now a total of 5 sets (2 identical sets for your work visa & 3 identical sets for your family's Family reunion visa)
    
8. And that's a wrap.
    

PS: *Get your prints/copies & photographs even before you leave your city/area for the Embassy. Although there is a copy, print-by-USB & photograph service available (at the shuttle service's reception in Islamabad), it is ridiculously expensive & you should avoid that unless you are filthy rich, don't care about money or were born with a golden spoon in your mouth.*
